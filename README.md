# Attack Defense Exercise (ADE)

## Objective of the Project:
The objective of the ADE project was to gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity, focusing on both offensive and defensive strategies. The exercise involved setting up a virtual environment to simulate attack scenarios and defend against them, thereby understanding the intricacies of network security, vulnerability exploitation, and defense mechanisms.

### Skills Learned:

Proficiency in setting up and configuring virtual environments for security testing.
Enhanced understanding of cybersecurity principles, including both attack and defense strategies.
Skills in identifying and exploiting system vulnerabilities.
Development of robust defense mechanisms to secure networks and systems.
Improved problem-solving and analytical thinking in the context of cybersecurity.

### Tools Used:

- **Virtualization Software (VMware ESXi):** Used for creating and managing virtual environments to simulate attack and defense scenarios.
- **Security Tools (e.g., Metasploit, Nmap):** Employed for vulnerability assessment and exploitation.
- **Network Monitoring Tools (e.g., Wireshark):** Utilized for analyzing network traffic and detecting intrusion attempts.
- **Scripting and Automation Tools (e.g., Python, Bash):** Used for automating tasks and creating custom scripts to enhance security testing procedures.

## Steps:

- **Virtual Environment Setup:** Configured a virtual environment using virtualization software, creating a controlled setting to simulate cyber attacks and defenses.
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** Used security tools to identify vulnerabilities in the virtual environment, understanding the potential entry points for attacks.
- **Exploitation:** Employed various techniques and tools to exploit identified vulnerabilities, simulating real-world cyber attack scenarios.
- **Defense Mechanism Implementation:** Developed and implemented defense strategies to protect the virtual environment against the simulated attacks, focusing on securing the network and systems.
- **Monitoring and Analysis:** Monitored network traffic and system behavior using network monitoring tools to detect and analyze attack patterns.
- **Documentation and Reporting:** Documented the entire process, from setting up the environment to the execution of attacks and implementation of defense strategies. This included detailed reports on the vulnerabilities found, exploitation methods used, and the effectiveness of defense mechanisms.
